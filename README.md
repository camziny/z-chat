This is an experimental app where I'm practicing all things LLM and AI. Built with Next.js as a playground for exploring:

- Fine-tuning language models
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Prompt engineering
- Vector databases
- AI agents and autonomous systems
- Natural language processing
- Multimodal AI systems
- Custom model training
